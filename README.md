# Java Streams Examples

This repository contains examples and exercises demonstrating the use of Java Streams. Java Streams are a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 for functional-style operations on collections and sequences of elements.

## Features

- **Functional Operations**: Demonstrates various functional operations like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.
- **Parallel Processing**: Shows how to leverage parallel processing using streams.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Explains the concept of lazy evaluation and its benefits.
- **Immutable**: Highlights the immutability aspect of streams.

## Examples

- [Example 1: Basic Stream Operations](examples/BasicOperations.java)
- [Example 2: Parallel Stream Processing](examples/ParallelProcessing.java)
- [Example 3: Lazy Evaluation](examples/LazyEvaluation.java)
- [Example 4: Immutable Streams](examples/ImmutableStreams.java)
